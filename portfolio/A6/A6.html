            A generational changing of the guards or a bifurcation of gamer behaviours?

    <p2>While the overall preference for the single player mode holds true across all age segments, the degree to which the single player mode is preferred differs significantly with age. For older gamer segments (35+), the single-player mode is mainstream and preference for multiplayer games remains niche. However, the younger the gamer, the less this difference is pronounced. Among gamers younger than 35 years old, the sum of those who prefer multiplayer games and those with no strong preference already surpasses the penetration of those who prefer single-player gameplay. It shows what the future of gamers will look like. In doing so, multiplayer addresses a new gamer need / preference that has arisen over time. Multiplayer modes often cater to a different set of needs – increasing the ability to socialise, express, and coexist in a digital environment with peers.</p2>
    <p2>There are a number of reasons for this age-defined dynamic. From having a reference to what each gamer grew up with during their formative years (20 years ago, multiplayer gameplay was less of a central focus in games than today), through to the slower reaction times of older segments putting them at a disadvantage online, and to older players having less time to allocate to gaming.</p2>
    <p2>The rise of multiplayer modes will continue... For consumers, it provides an additional use case – the ability to socialise and self-express in the digital environment. For games developers, doubling down on multiplayer makes sense from the commercial perspective, as multiplayer gamers spend more time and money on games than single player preferring gamers.</p2>

     <header>My Own 2 Cents
    </header>
   	<p2> In my opinion, I can agree with most of what Severin is saying. I think that the fact that most players who spend their time playing single-player games are generally older than most of the general gaming age demograohic, and that somply is the case due to adults having more responsibilties and less time to theirselves. Additionaly, when said adults do find themselves with some free time, they most likely would want to spend it by playing something that actually relives stress rather than creating more tension. Although the multi-player gaming scene is much more adrenaline packed and high octane, it can be a very hostile and stressful enviroment. Something much more to the younger demographics im sure. Multi-player games nowadays are much more technical and precicise than they used to be even by just a few years ago. You would definitley find myounger aged players if you choose to play online. What I do like about multi-player is that you get an oppurtunity to make a private party with freinds and play a game together in the comfort of your own homes. However, because the older demographic of gamers usually have very little free time, it is quite difficult to arrange a set time where all your friends are free to play aswell, hence most older gamers stick to a single-player game to find some enjoyment in their solitude. </p2>
