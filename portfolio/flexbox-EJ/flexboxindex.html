		<p>In a world inundated with information, discerning fact from fiction has become increasingly challenging. This reality has sparked my interest in the concept of the "fictitious truth," particularly as it pertains to modern media. For my final project, I propose to create a contemporary fake tabloid story and website, drawing inspiration from the now-defunct Weekly World News, which captivated readers with its outrageous and often absurd fictional news stories from 1979 to 2007. This project will not only explore the nature of fictitious truth but also examine its implications in today's media landscape.
</p>
		<p>I'm creating a website to celebrate the quirky charm of Weekly World News' BatBoy by sharing fictitious sightings and stories. I love the blend of absurdity and creativity that BatBoy embodies, so I plan to redesign him with a modern twist to appeal to today's audience. This project is also about having fun with nostalgia while giving a fresh spin to a beloved character, inviting others to experience the wild world of BatBoy once again.</p>
